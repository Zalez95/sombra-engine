	 * Class RenderGraph, it's a directed graph in which RenderNodes represents
	 * each of the nodes of the graph and their Input and Output connectors act
	 * as the edges. The RenderGraph is needed for implementing multi-pass
	 * Techiques because it ensures the order of execution of the different
	 * RenderNodes.
	 * Every RenderGraph by default has a "resources" BindableRenderNode where
	 * all the global Bindable resources can be accessed from other RenderNodes.
	 * This "resources" RenderNode also has a "defaultFB" output with the
	 * default FrameBuffer to draw to.
	 * The RenderGraph nodes will be executed from top to bottom, this means
	 * that the parent nodes will be executed prior to the child ones. If some
	 * nodes are at the same level, they will be executed in the same order
	 * that they've added to the RenderGraph.
